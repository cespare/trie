# Trie

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cespare/trie.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cespare/trie)

This is a Go package implementing a trie (prefix tree) over byte slices.

This is a temporary naive implementation that will be replaced with a double-array trie (see
https://github.com/cespare/go-trie). The API will hopefully remain unchanged.
